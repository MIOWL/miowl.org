                <p>
                    The development of Medical Interprofessional Open source Web-based Library (MI OWL) occurred when a group of physicians in the rural, remote community of Marathon, in Northwestern Ontario, became a Family Health Team in 2005.  Becoming an interprofessional team was an impetus to create a variety of new programs for our patient population.  We were challenged in this endeavor by the lack of available information on such clinical innovations and the inability to easily share information with other clinical teams.  With an Innovations grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care one of the Marathon Family Health Team physicians, Eliseo Orrantia, embarked on creating MI OWL with the help of Joseph Newing (IT) and Margaret Cousins (epidemiologist).  We employed the services of Alan Wynn, of <a href="http://friendlydev.com" target="_NEW" title="FriendlyDev: Your friendly web developer!" class="links">FriendlyDev</a> as the primary programmer.

                <h2 id="Principles">Principles</h2>
                <p>
                    MI OWL is rooted in several principles which include being: a free service, advertisement free, open source and widely accessible.  MI OWL is a noncommercial site.  Its creators do not wish to make any financial profit from its use, nor have others do so.  Being open source allows for the program to be improved upon by other interested parties.  It can also be adapted, with minor modifications, to provide a similar service in other countries.  Beyond the health care application, the basic programming of MI OWL could be used to make a library of libraries for any myriad of topics.   The primary intent of MI OWL is to support health care providers in their care provision within our Canadian health care system.  As our system is publically funded, we believe that the body of knowledge that it creates should be freely accessible to all.  Improved sharing among health care providers can enhance the system’s function and evolution.  As well, transparency with the public makes us more directly accountable.
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    MI OWL has been created to provide Canadian primary care clinics and small community hospitals with a tool to create their own web-based document libraries. These libraries allow the organizing, searching and sharing of the information that health care facilities rely on to provide patient care. Such information can be policies, program descriptions, forms, medical directives and patient resources for example. Individual libraries can be organized as desired depending on need and preference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fundamental goal of MI OWL is to create access to information. This is achieved by allowing the libraries to be perused and searched by all those interested. This facilitates us to share and build on what health organizations have already created. It saves time and effort as well as creating a greater collaborative culture in health care.

                <ul class="out-links">
                    <li><a href="#BrowseLibraries">Browsing libraries</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#SearchContent">Site Search</a></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="clear"></div>

                <h2 id="BrowseLibraries">Browsing libraries</h2>
                <p>
                    You can look through individual libraries by clicking on “OWLs” on the top right of MI OWL pages.  This will bring you to the OWL Choice page.  From there you can select the desired library from the drop down list by clicking on “choose”, in the lower right of that screen.  You will be taken to the particular library’s OWL Details page.   Clicking “list” under the heading of “categories”, on the left hand side of that page, will bring up the table of contents for that particular OWL.  Clicking on a particular category within that list will bring up all the document files stored under that category.  More information on a particular file can then be discovered by clicking on the tag icon to the right of the file name.  Another way to look through the files in a particular OWL is to click on “browse” under the “uploads” heading on the left side of an OWL’s Details page.  This will bring up a list of all the files within that OWL.  More information on a particular file can be discovered by clicking on its tag icon to the right of the file name.  Files can be downloaded, or printed by clicking on the appropriate icon to the right of the file name.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <h2 id="SearchContent">Site Search</h2>
                <p>
                    Content within the MI OWL site and all its libraries can be searched by clicking on “site search” at the top left of the MI OWL’s pages.  This will bring up the general “Search form” page where you will be prompted to enter 3 different search limits and then the topic to be searched.  Clicking on “search” on the lower right of the Search Form page will then run the inquiry.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <h2 id="LiveSearch">Live search</h2>
                <p>The following are the two ways to use a search function when within a particular library.</p>
                <p>
                    Clicking on “list” under the “Categories” heading on the left side of the page within a particular OWL will take one to the “Owl Categories” page that lists all the file categories for that particular OWL. Clicking on a particular category from that list takes you to the “File Browser” page which lists all the files under the chosen category. Above the list of files is a box with the words “Live Search”. Typing words in this book will search the files within the category and select those that have the key words in their file name, or description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other way to search within a particular library is to click on “browse” beneath the heading “Uploads” on the left side of the page within an OWL. This takes one to the “OWL Uploads” page where there is a listing of all the files within that particular library. Above the list of files is a box with the words “Live Search”. Typing key words in this box will search all files and select those that have the key words in their file name, or description.

                    MI OWL is an open source tool as its source code is readily available.  MI OWL is programmed using the programming language PHP and the data base is constructed with MySQL.  It is built using Codeigniter to construct a framework of models, views and controllers.  If you are interested in looking at, or downloading the source code please go to <a href="https://github.com/MIOWL/miowl.org" title="MI OWL Source code hosted on GitHub" target="_NEW" class="links">https://github.com/MIOWL/miowl.org</a>

                <p>
                    We welcome your suggestions on how MI OWL might be improved.  Please contact us at <?php print safe_mailto('support@miowl.org', 'support@miowl.org', 'class="mailto"'); ?> with your ideas. If you are interested in adding to, or changing the functionality of MI OWL yourself, please take a look at the MI OWL source code at <a href="https://github.com/MIOWL/miowl.org" title="MI OWL Source code hosted on GitHub" target="_NEW" class="links">https://github.com/MIOWL/miowl.org</a> to see examples of the formatting we would like followed.
